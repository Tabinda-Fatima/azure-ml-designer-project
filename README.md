# Azure ML Studio - Bike Rental Regression Pipeline

This repository contains a machine learning pipeline built using **Azure Machine Learning Studio Designer** to predict bike rentals based on various features.

## 📌 Project Overview

The goal of this project is to build a regression model to predict bike rental counts using a no-code, drag-and-drop interface in Azure ML Studio.

**Note:** This project was built using Azure ML Designer's no-code interface to demonstrate the full machine learning pipeline without any programming.

## 🔧 Workflow Steps

- Dataset uploaded and relevant columns selected  
- Missing values cleaned and warnings handled  
- Data split into training (70%) and testing (30%) sets  
- Regression model (initial) trained and evaluated  
- Model cloned and **Boosted Decision Tree Regression** applied  
- Model trained, scored, and evaluated  
- Model saved and submitted via Azure ML Studio interface  

## 📊 Results

- Evaluation metrics (e.g., Mean Absolute Error, RMSE, R²) were generated via the “Evaluate Model” block  
- Final screenshots of the model pipeline are included below  
- *(Note: Evaluation result screenshot will be added later when available)*
